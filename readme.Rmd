### A Flexible Syntax for Population Dynamic Modelling

Population dynamic models underpin a range of analyses and applications in
ecology and epidemiology. The various approaches for fitting and analysing these
models (MPMs, IPMs, ODEs, POMPs, PVA, with and without metapopulation structure)
are generally fitted using different software, each with a different interface.
This makes it difficult to combine various modelling approaches and data types
to solve a given problem. pop aims to provide a flexible and easy to use common
interface for constructing population dynamic models and enabling to them to be
fitted and analysed in various ways.
