Description: Population dynamic models underpin a range of analyses and
    applications in ecology and epidemiology. The various approaches for fitting
    and analysing these models (MPMs, IPMs, ODEs, POMPs, PVA, with and without
    metapopulation structure) are generally fitted using different software, each
    with a different interface. This makes it difficult to combine various modelling
    approaches and data types to solve a given problem. pop aims to provide a
    flexible and easy to use common interface for constructing population dynamic
    models and enabling to them to be fitted and analysed in various ways.
