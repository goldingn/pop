Description: Population dynamic models underpin a range of analyses and applications in ecology and epidemiology. The various approaches for analysing population dynamics models (MPMs, IPMs, ODEs, POMPs, PVA) each require the model to be defined in a different way. This makes it difficult to combine different modelling approaches and data types to solve a given problem. `pop` aims to provide a flexible and easy to use common interface for constructing population dynamic models and enabling to them to be fitted and analysed in lots of different ways.
